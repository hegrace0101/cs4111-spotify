Implementation Details
    What hasn't been implemented:
        - search bar by song name
        - profile page and setting page (combined into one page)
        - list of followers and following (with unfollow buttons) 
        - list of liked songs, their artists, and their albums (with unlike buttons)
        - a playlist page with the playlists you have created, as well as those you followers
          (made interactive by letting you click on the playlist to see more details on which songs
          are in there and who the playlist is made by)
        - aforementioned individual playlist pages along with liked songs page have hrefs to 
          individual artist and album pages (redundancy to mimic the spotify UI that lets you access
          the information from various pages)

    What hasn't been implemented:
        - picture attribute for members 
        - age function()

2 Web Pages with the the most interesting database operations in terms of what the pages are used for, 
how the page is related to the database operations (e.g., inputs on the page are used in such and such 
way to produce database operations that do such and such), and why you think they are interesting.
